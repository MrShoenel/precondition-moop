# Pre-conditioning of multi-objective optimization problems

In this repository, we gather code, experimental setups, and results for
attempting to *pre-condition* multi-objective optimization problems
(MOOPs).

In this repository, you will find:

-   [**Notebooks** (R)](./notebooks) - Notebooks that can be (re-)run by
    users to reproduce our results. All results are included, such that
    the notebooks will only recompute them if you delete them. The
    notebooks are very detailed and document all steps necessary.
    -   [**An Approach to Ordering Objectives and Pareto Efficient
        Solutions**](./notebooks/pareto-order.md) - A second notebook
        focusing on a low- or no-preference approach to ordering Pareto
        efficient solutions and single objectives. There exists a
        paper-like render of this notebook on arXiv for the time being
        <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.15291> (Hönel and Löwe
        2022).
    -   [**Pre-conditioning of multi-objective optimization
        problems**](./notebooks/precondition-moop.md) - The first
        notebook of this repository.
-   [**Results** (RDS)](./results) - All data required for reproduction
    is included. All the results, too. Some of these may take a long
    time to compute, so be aware.
