# Pre-conditioning of multi-objective optimization problems

In this repository, we gather code, experimental setups, and results for
attempting to *pre-condition* multi-objective optimization problems
(MOOPs).

In this repository, you will find:

-   [**Notebooks** (R)](./notebooks) - Notebooks that can be (re-)run by
    users to reproduce our results. All results are included, such that
    the notebooks will only recompute them if you delete them. The
    notebooks are very detailed and document all steps necessary.
    -   [**Pre-conditioning of multi-objective optimization
        problems**](./notebooks/precondition-moop.md) - The main
        notebook of this repository.
-   [**Results** (RDS)](./results) - All data required for reproduction
    is included. All the results, too. Some of these may take a long
    time to compute, so be aware.
